# 🎓 College ID Verification using Deep Learning

## 📖 Project Overview

This project is an AI-powered College ID Verification System that detects whether a college ID card is genuine or suspicious using a Convolutional Autoencoder built with PyTorch.

The system reconstructs the uploaded ID image and calculates the reconstruction error. If the error is below a predefined threshold, the ID is classified as Genuine; otherwise, it is classified as Suspicious/Fake.

The project also includes a FastAPI backend and a simple HTML, CSS, and JavaScript frontend for real-time verification.
